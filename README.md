# IXL Optimizations

Welcome to the IXL Optimizations README.md. Here I will talk about all of the things you need to know, and a link to the source code if you want to make sure that this extension won't allow your students to cheat.

### Features:

##### Auto Search Redirect

Auto search redirect allows students to easily go to a skill by id, just by typing in the IXL search bar the skill ID and pressing enter.

##### Chrome search bar for IXL skill search

This feature allows you to quickly search for IXL skills directly in the chrome search bar. Just type in "skill", press TAB on your keyboard, and then type in what you want to search. When you press enter, it will take you to the ixl search page. This also works with "Auto Search Redirect", so you can type in a skill's id and search and it will take you to the skill.

##### Set input width

Set input width is just like it sounds. It sets the width of inputs, so that you have more space to type in. You can customize the width you want it to set to in the [config](https://github.com/SpyC0der77/IXL-Optimizations?tab=readme-ov-file#easy-configuration).

##### Challenge Zone Popup Skipping

Challenge Zone Popup Skipping automatically clicks the close button on the popup saying "Are you ready for the challenge zone?" so that you can keep mathing without any interuptions.

##### Key limiting

Key limiting is a feature that only allows certain keys to be pressed when doing an IXL skill. Not recommended for use in algebra, since it blocks characters, meaning that variables will not be able to be typed.

##### Incomplete answer popup closing
Incomplete answer popup closing is a QOL feature that automatically closes the incomplete answer popup. This saves you time, because if you accidentally press enter, then you won't have to click the close button, because it does it for you.

##### Easy Configuration

Easy configuration is a must for all chrome extensions. With IXL Optimizations Easy Configuration ("config") you can easily change what you want this extension to do. All of the features listed above are able to be turned off. To open the config, just click on the extensions button in the top right of your chrome browser, and then click on the IXL Optimizations button. This will popup the config. For easy access, click the pin button (Thumbtack) next to the extension name.
